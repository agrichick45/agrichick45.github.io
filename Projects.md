This is a brief description of the major current projects: 

## ORISE Fellowship: Soil Carbon Data


## Rural Risk and Environmental Justice in the Mississippi River Basin
There are many different definitions of risk, just like there are many different definitions of rural. Over the course of the summer I worked to aggregated over [500 columns of data](https://agrichick45.github.io/EDF/), from socio-economic indicators, medical health indicators, environmental quality, water availablility, agricultural production dynamics, strengh, population changes, job numbers, debt to asset ratios, and more.

#### Several projects came from this: 
This [ESRI Storymap](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/3ec5284d3d60492e84c60e4b407df954) was a collaborative effort with Dana VanHuis (MS Student, University of Michigan) looks at how leeves, flooding, impaired waters, animal density, and farmer debt to asset correlate with the Baseline Resilience Indicators for Communities [(BRIC)](https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/376770c1113943b6b5f6b58ff1c2fb5c/page/page_8/), which uses socio-economic data to figure in disaster resilience.

Another Risk indicator looked at the [agricultural makeup](https://agrichick45.github.io/RuralRisk/AgDiver.html) and diversity of rural counties, using hierarchical clustering algorithms. This project evolved into a [shiny app](github.com/agrichick45/ag_intensity_shiny) allowing for interactive selection of some key variables behind agricultural intensification, and dynamic visualizations in 

A fall project looked at [The Dark Underbelly](https://agrichick45.github.io/RuralRisk/DarkRisk.html) of rural America, focusing on lost idenity, the tenents of the True Believer, and how our economic system created three major catalysts toward fundamentalism: The New Poor,
Frustration, and Passionate Hatred. (Content warning, contains conversations about assault, deaths of despair)


## Optimizing Nitrogen Reduction with Wetland Restoration
The United States Corn belt Nitrogen from the Upper Mississippi River Basin provide nearly 40% of the nitrogen pollution to the Gulf of Mexico, with Iowa being the first or second biggest contributor the toxic dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico. Despite years of work in extension, cropping practice change, and concerted efforts on the parts of farmers and government officials alike, there does not seem to be any overall improvement in overall nitrogen loss.
