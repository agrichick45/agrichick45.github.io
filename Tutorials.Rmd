# Tutorials

This areas is for the projects and visualization tutorials that I wished that I had when I started using R for GIS and raster based processing. Some of these focus on machine learning techniques, raster manipulation, spatio-temporal analysis and visualizations focused on soil carbon, land use change, and rural cropping dynamics.

## The Terra Package and Raster Statistics

Skills: API/server Download, projections, zonal statistics, Bivariate Chloropleth Maps, spatial data frame manipulations, dumbbell plots 

Right now, I am editing, organizing, and processing two major projects based on the markdown files that will be translated into a github page from the [Agricultural Land Repository](https://github.com/agrichick45/AgLandUse)

## United States Cropland Transitions

This project mines the NASS acreage datasets and the cropland data layer, looking at both cropland expansion, as well as corn and soybean production patterns.
